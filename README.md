# IRC Channel Rules

General Conduct:

All users must adhere to Libera Chat's network rules. Intolerance, sexism, racism, and other forms of discrimination are strictly prohibited.

Channel Operations:

The channel operator is responsible for keeping disruptive discussions at a minimum. While off-topic discussions are welcome, flamewars, trolling, and spam are not tolerated. The operator has full discretion to manage discussions to prevent them from becoming disruptive. This can go from issuing a fair warning, to silencing or banning the involved parties.

Handling Disputes:

Any discussion that devolves into prolonged bickering without resolution is considered disruptive. All participants in such discussions will face sanctions to ensure a constructive channel environment.


These rules aim to foster a respectful and focused community. Thank you for your cooperation.
